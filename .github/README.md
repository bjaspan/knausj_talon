This is my fork of knausj85/knausj_talon.  It is for new feature
development to be submitted upstream and also for Talon dictation on
my local workstation.

Branches:

* main: A pristine copy of the upstream origin.
* [feature branch]: Feature development not yet merged upstream.  Pull requests
  to my feature branches are welcome.
* local: main but with all [feature branch]es merged in plus any
  personal changes that I do not (yet?) plan to suggest for merging
  upstream. This is what I use for dictation with Talon; it lets me
  use all the features I have in development.  My current personal changes:
  * Improved dictation formatting commands in bjaspan-dictation.talon.
  * drowse command
  * mixed mode command (though I do not use mixed mode anymore)
